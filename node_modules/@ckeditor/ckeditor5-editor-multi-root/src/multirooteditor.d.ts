/**
 * The {@glink installation/getting-started/predefined-builds#multi-root-editor multi-root editor} implementation.
 *
 * The multi-root editor provides multiple inline editable elements and a toolbar. All editable areas are controlled by one editor
 * instance, which means that they share common configuration, document ID, or undo stack.
 *
 * This type of editor is dedicated to integrations which require a customized UI with an open structure, featuring multiple editable areas,
 * allowing developers to have a control over the exact location of these editable areas.
 *
 * In order to create a multi-root editor instance, use the static
 * {@link module:editor-multi-root/multirooteditor~MultiRootEditor.create `MultiRootEditor.create()`} method.
 *
 * Note that you will need to attach the editor toolbar to your web page manually, in a desired place, after the editor is initialized.
 *
 * # Multi-root editor and multi-root editor build
 *
 * The multi-root editor can be used directly from source (if you installed the
 * [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-multi-root`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-multi-root) package)
 * but it is also available in the
 * {@glink installation/getting-started/predefined-builds#multi-root-editor multi-root editor build}.
 *
 * {@glink installation/getting-started/predefined-builds Builds} are ready-to-use editors with plugins bundled in.
 *
 * When using the editor from source you need to take care of loading all plugins by yourself
 * (through the {@link module:core/editor/editorconfig~EditorConfig#plugins `config.plugins`} option).
 * Using the editor from source gives much better flexibility and allows for easier customization.
 *
 * Read more about initializing the editor from source or as a build in
 * {@link module:editor-multi-root/multirooteditor~MultiRootEditor.create `MultiRootEditor.create()`}.

     * ```ts
     * editor.addRoot( 'myRoot', { data: '<p>Initial root data.</p>' } );

     *
     * After a root is added, you will be able to modify and retrieve its data.
     *
     * All root names must be unique. An error will be thrown if you will try to create a root with the name same as
     * an already existing, attached root. However, you can call this method for a detached root. See also {@link #detachRoot}.
     *
     * Whenever a root is added, the editor instance will fire {@link #event:addRoot `addRoot` event}. The event is also called when
     * the root is added indirectly, e.g. by the undo feature or on a remote client during real-time collaboration.
     *
     * Note, that this method only adds a root to the editor model. It **does not** create a DOM editable element for the new root.
     * Until such element is created (and attached to the root), the root is "virtual": it is not displayed anywhere and its data can
     * be changed only using the editor API.
     *
     * To create a DOM editable element for the root, listen to {@link #event:addRoot `addRoot` event} and call {@link #createEditable}.
     * Then, insert the DOM element in a desired place, that will depend on the integration with your application and your requirements.
     *
     * ```ts
     * editor.on( 'addRoot', ( evt, root ) => {
     * 	const editableElement = editor.createEditable( root );
     *
     * 	// You may want to create a more complex DOM structure here.
     * 	//
     * 	// Alternatively, you may want to create a DOM structure before
     * 	// calling `editor.addRoot()` and only append `editableElement` at
     * 	// a proper place.
     *
     * 	document.querySelector( '#editors' ).appendChild( editableElement );
     * } );
     *
     * // ...
     *
     * editor.addRoot( 'myRoot' ); // Will create a root, a DOM editable element and append it to `#editors` container element.
     * ```
     *
     * You can set root attributes on the new root while you add it:
     *
     * ```ts
     * // Add a collapsed root at fourth position from top.
     * // Keep in mind that these are just examples of attributes. You need to provide your own features that will handle the attributes.
     * editor.addRoot( 'myRoot', { attributes: { isCollapsed: true, index: 4 } } );
     * ```

     *
     * By setting `isUndoable` flag to `true`, you can allow for detaching the root using the undo feature.
     *
     * Additionally, you can group adding multiple roots in one undo step. This can be useful if you add multiple roots that are
     * combined into one, bigger UI element, and want them all to be undone together.
     *
     * ```ts

     * **Note:** remember that `MultiRootEditor` does not append the toolbar element to your web page, so you have to do it manually
     * after the editor has been initialized.
     *
     * There are a few different ways to initialize the multi-root editor.
     *
     * # Using existing DOM elements:
     *
     * ```ts
     * MultiRootEditor.create( {
     * 	intro: document.querySelector( '#editor-intro' ),
     * 	content: document.querySelector( '#editor-content' ),
     * 	sidePanelLeft: document.querySelector( '#editor-side-left' ),
     * 	sidePanelRight: document.querySelector( '#editor-side-right' ),
     * 	outro: document.querySelector( '#editor-outro' )
     * } )
     * .then( editor => {
     * 	console.log( 'Editor was initialized', editor );
     *
     * 	// Append the toolbar inside a provided DOM element.
     * 	document.querySelector( '#toolbar-container' ).appendChild( editor.ui.view.toolbar.element );
     * } )
     * .catch( err => {
     * 	console.error( err.stack );
     * } );
     * ```
     *
     * The elements' content will be used as the editor data and elements will become editable elements.
     *
     * # Creating a detached editor
     *
     * Alternatively, you can initialize the editor by passing the initial data directly as strings.
     * In this case, you will have to manually append both the toolbar element and the editable elements to your web page.
     *
     * ```ts
     * MultiRootEditor.create( {
     * 	intro: '<p><strong>Exciting</strong> intro text to an article.</p>',
     * 	content: '<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>',
     * 	sidePanelLeft: '<blockquote>Strong quotation from article.</blockquote>',
     * 	sidePanelRight: '<p>List of similar articles...</p>',
     * 	outro: '<p>Closing text.</p>'
     * } )
     * .then( editor => {
     * 	console.log( 'Editor was initialized', editor );
     *
     * 	// Append the toolbar inside a provided DOM element.
     * 	document.querySelector( '#toolbar-container' ).appendChild( editor.ui.view.toolbar.element );
     *
     * 	// Append DOM editable elements created by the editor.
     * 	const editables = editor.ui.view.editables;
     * 	const container = document.querySelector( '#editable-container' );
     *
     * 	container.appendChild( editables.intro.element );
     * 	container.appendChild( editables.content.element );
     * 	container.appendChild( editables.outro.element );
     * } )
     * .catch( err => {
     * 	console.error( err.stack );
     * } );
     * ```
     *
     * This lets you dynamically append the editor to your web page whenever it is convenient for you. You may use this method if your
     * web page content is generated on the client side and the DOM structure is not ready at the moment when you initialize the editor.
     *
     * # Using an existing DOM element (and data provided in `config.initialData`)
     *
     * You can also mix these two ways by providing a DOM element to be used and passing the initial data through the configuration:
     *
     * ```ts
     * MultiRootEditor.create( {
     * 	intro: document.querySelector( '#editor-intro' ),
     * 	content: document.querySelector( '#editor-content' ),
     * 	sidePanelLeft: document.querySelector( '#editor-side-left' ),
     * 	sidePanelRight: document.querySelector( '#editor-side-right' ),
     * 	outro: document.querySelector( '#editor-outro' )
     * }, {
     * 	initialData: {
     * 		intro: '<p><strong>Exciting</strong> intro text to an article.</p>',
     * 		content: '<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>',
     * 		sidePanelLeft '<blockquote>Strong quotation from article.</blockquote>':
     * 		sidePanelRight '<p>List of similar articles...</p>':
     * 		outro: '<p>Closing text.</p>'
     * 	}
     * } )
     * .then( editor => {
     * 	console.log( 'Editor was initialized', editor );
     *
     * 	// Append the toolbar inside a provided DOM element.
     * 	document.querySelector( '#toolbar-container' ).appendChild( editor.ui.view.toolbar.element );
     * } )
     * .catch( err => {
     * 	console.error( err.stack );
     * } );
     * ```
     *
     * This method can be used to initialize the editor on an existing element with the specified content in case if your integration
     * makes it difficult to set the content of the source element.
     *
     * Note that an error will be thrown if you pass the initial data both as the first parameter and also in the configuration.
     *
     * # Configuring the editor
     *
     * See the {@link module:core/editor/editorconfig~EditorConfig editor configuration documentation} to learn more about
     * customizing plugins, toolbar and more.
     *
     * # Using the editor from source
     *
     * The code samples listed in the previous sections of this documentation assume that you are using an
     * {@glink installation/getting-started/predefined-builds editor build}
     * (for example – `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-multi-root`).
     *
     * If you want to use the multi-root editor from source (`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-multi-root-editor/src/multirooteditor`),
     * you need to define the list of
     * {@link module:core/editor/editorconfig~EditorConfig#plugins plugins to be initialized} and
     * {@link module:core/editor/editorconfig~EditorConfig#toolbar toolbar items}. Read more about using the editor from
     * source in the {@glink installation/advanced/alternative-setups/integrating-from-source-webpack dedicated guide}.
     *
     * @param sourceElementsOrData The DOM elements that will be the source for the created editor
     * or the editor's initial data. The editor will initialize multiple roots with names according to the keys in the passed object.
     *
     * If DOM elements are passed, their content will be automatically loaded to the editor upon initialization and the elements will be
     * used as the editor's editable areas. The editor data will be set back to the original element once the editor is destroyed if the
     * {@link module:core/editor/editorconfig~EditorConfig#updateSourceElementOnDestroy updateSourceElementOnDestroy} option
